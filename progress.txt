## Session 3 - 2026-02-22

### FIX 1: Forced Profile Flow — COMPLETE
- First-time users (no profile in localStorage) now land on a setup/onboarding screen
- Setup collects: Dog Name (required), Breed (optional), Default Status color (optional)
- Continue button is disabled/grayed out until Dog Name is filled in
- After saving, user proceeds to home screen with signal buttons
- Returning users with a saved profile skip straight to home
- No way to reach signal buttons without completing profile
- Added `hasProfile()` helper to profile.ts
- Created new SetupScreen.tsx component

### FIX 3: Profile Save Validation — COMPLETE
- Dog Name field marked as required with red asterisk
- Save button disabled until Dog Name has at least 1 character
- Red border + error message shown if user tries to save with empty name
- Breed field added to profile (optional)
- Both SetupScreen and ProfileScreen share the same validation behavior

### FIX 2: Back Button Navigation — COMPLETE
- Profile, About, and Share screens now have a round 44x44px back button (easy mobile tap target)
- Signal screen has a ✕ close button in top-left corner that goes straight home
- Signal screen tap-anywhere-to-go-back still works (in solid mode)
- All back buttons are visually consistent across screens

### NEW FEATURE: Blinking Signal Mode — COMPLETE
- Tapping a color on home screen starts blinking immediately (1s on, 1s off against black)
- Camera flash/LED (torch) blinks in sync with the screen when device supports it
- Camera permission requested on first use; graceful fallback if denied
- First tap on signal screen: blinking stops, solid color locks in, torch off
- Second tap: returns to home screen
- Hint text updates: "Tap to lock color" during blink, "Tap to go back" when solid
- Camera stream cleaned up on unmount (no resource leaks)
